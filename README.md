This Project serves as a development test version of the Phase 4 Project for Flatiron School.  This version of the project uses sqlite3 as the database and was done to troubleshoot the bulk of the code that I plan to do for the front end and back end.  The models and tables for "orders" and "order_items" was depreciated in favor of "carts" and "cart_items".
